# KQ-Code-Sample

A Code sample of a property selector Page. The page was created by 1) Creating a custom post type and custom php templates in WordPress 2) Customizing the dashboard with Advanced Custom Fields and pulling ACF data into the template. 3) The non JavaScript page simply outputs all properties and links to their individual pages using PHP and WordPress. The enhanced page uses Javascript to build a mini navigation from property types ACF includes in a "data-prop-type" attribute, which then allows users to view only desired properties (i.e. Industrial/Commercial/Land).

The files in the repo are just for reference and don't actually work since they're outside of the WordPress install. You can view it live [here](http://yeskingandqueen.com/buildings-and-sites/)
